# Parasyte Web Template

A modern, anime-inspired portfolio template, customized from the Start Bootstrap Agency theme.  
I rebuilt, Dockerized, and deployed this project to demonstrate my DevOps, CI/CD, and cloud skills.

---

## 🚀 Idea
I wanted to create a professional portfolio site with an anime flair (inspired by *Parasyte*) while also showcasing my DevOps toolchain and deployment process.

---

## 🛠️ Process
1. Customized the **Start Bootstrap Agency** template.  
2. Containerized the app with **Docker**.  
3. Deployed using **GitHub Pages** (static hosting).  
4. Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated builds.  
5. Added monitoring and Kubernetes manifests for advanced deployment.  
6. Linked screenshots and live demo in my portfolio.

### 🔹 Why this is better
- It **shows your work** (Docker, CI/CD, K8s).  
- It **links the live demo**.  
- It **has screenshots** (you already saved them in `public/images/`).  
- It’s **professional**, and much more appealing to recruiters/tech leads.  

---

👉 To your question: *“test deploy i did not include it, so what do I do?”*  
- That’s fine 👍 The "test deploy" doesn’t matter. Just make sure your README **documents the final deployment steps** (e.g., GitHub Pages + Docker).  

---

Do you want me to also write a **README.md template for your portfolio repo** (the one where you list all projects and blogs), so both repos look professional?
